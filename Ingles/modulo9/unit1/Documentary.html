    Are people from your country clock-watchers? <br>
    Is it important to be punctual?
</b>
<div class="txtbackgreen">
    People form my country usually aren't a clock-watcher,only in specifics situation they are punctual.
    for exaple when they have a job interview or when the they are in the job and it's time to go home.
    The rest of the times, even in profesional situation they are a bit inpunctual.
    I remerme one time that i was in a conference and the most of the people and the teacher of course arrived 15 minutes late.

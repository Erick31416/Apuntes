Most people believe that health is very important and, because of this, many
are trying to eat more healthily. For example, people in the UK are eating less salth and
more low fat margarine and milk; fruits is now America's second-favorite snack
and Japan is curreltly promoting cocoa because it is healthy alternative to second-favoritedrinks like CocaCola.
These changes in eating habits are also having and effect on the food market Global sales
are incresing for soy drinks and drinkable yoghurts more than any other food and sales of bread,
pasta, and cereals are growing much more slowly. People are also becoming more interested in
fresh fruit and vegetables and 'farmers markets' are getting more popular
throughout Europe. When they can, people offen opt for 'natural goodness', and they're buying
more productos that are healthy, like fruit, salad, and nuts, They are also buying products that help to protect the environment,
like organic vegetables. So it's clear that things in the food world will never be the same again.
